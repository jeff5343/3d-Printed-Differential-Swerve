# 3d Printed Differential Swerve

Not finished

CAD is based off of https://www.printables.com/model/300105-differential-swerve-drive <br>
I wanted to make a really small swerve bot from scratch and after many failed attempts I found WildWilly's design <br>
So I used his design as an example and cadded a smaller (and a lot jankier) version <br>

CAD progress as of now:
